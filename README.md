# Housing-Prices

The main goal of this project was to see if I could use machine learning to train an algorithm to be able to accurately predict the price of a house given a number of characteristics. I used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests in order to do this. The data is from a competition on Kaggle (link in code).
